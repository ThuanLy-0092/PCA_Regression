# PCA Regression

This repository explores the practical application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction using a real-world dataset. The goal is to implement PCA, analyze its effectiveness in reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data, and evaluate its impact on machine learning model performance.

## Objective

In this assignment, we delve into the application of PCA to understand its effectiveness in reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving essential characteristics. We use a real-world dataset to implement PCA and explore its implications for machine learning tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunraskar/cancer-regression/data). It contains features related to cancer characteristics.

## Tasks

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Perform necessary steps to handle missing values in the dataset.
2. **Scaling Numerical Features:** Normalize or standardize numerical features as required.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** If applicable, encode categorical variables using suitable techniques.

### Implement PCA

1. Utilize scikit-learn to implement PCA on the preprocessed dataset.
2. Experiment with different numbers of principal components.
3. Visualize the explained variance ratio to understand the contribution of each principal component.

### Dimensionality Reduction

1. Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
2. Determine a suitable number of principal components to retain sufficient information.
3. Compare the performance of machine learning models (e.g., linear regression) on original vs. reduced-dimensional datasets using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### Interpretation and Analysis

1. Analyze the results of PCA transformation and dimensionality reduction.
2. Interpret principal components and their corresponding eigenvectors to understand the underlying data structure.
3. Discuss trade-offs observed between dimensionality reduction and model performance.

### Report and Conclusion

1. Prepare a concise report summarizing findings, methodology, and insights gained from the assignment.
2. Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate key observations.
3. Highlight the importance of PCA in dimensionality reduction and its implications for real-world data analysis.
